IMPORTANT NOTE: Development of FGC has been discontinued due to sunset phase starting on June 24, 2021. 
This means that I will no longer be testing this ruleset in FGC. I can only guarantee that it works in FGU.

FINISHED/FIXED:

GitHub Update #14 (not uploaded yet)
August 31, 2021
Fixed PC Actions tab adding multiples of descriptions on roll.
Fixed NPC rolls to correctly use modifier widget.
Added Karma Widget to control karma use. This only works for PCs, since NPCs don't have karma.
Karma will not be added to skill rolls, or pure karma die rolls.
Adding "karma" to PC Actions tab rolls will still function as before.

GitHub Update #13
July 14, 2021
Moved the changelog and TODO list to separate files due to their growing sizes. (previously was located inside comment block of base.xml)
Changed modifierstack to only reset on result. 
  This is to prevent stack from being cleared if the player picks up dice, but doesn't roll them.
Updated getRoll to show modified step numbers.
Updated StepLookup to use new formulaic method. (Yes, there is a formula for step numbers. No, it's not pretty or official.)
  This fixed using wrong step dice for steps 40+ as well as optimized code. This also removed the max step # limitation.

GitHub Update #12
July 13, 2021
Created "Step Roll" widget, (similar to the Mod window) that allows you to enter a step number and roll it.
Fixed "spellcasting test" rolls to be separate type from "spell" rolls, so they don't try to target/multitarget.

GitHub Update #11
July 01, 2021
Fixed karma rolls to only deduct once per action test. (not per target) Hopefully.
Automated recovery tests per day.
Added Matrix checkboxes to spells list, this is just for the player to keep track. (Standard, Enhanced)
Fix attack/spell/damage/heal messages to have hit/miss/dmg/heal icons.

GitHub Update #10
June 30, 2021
Fixed mystic damage rolls.

GitHub Update #9
June 30, 2021:

GitHub Update #8
June 20, 2021:
Updating ActionManagerED4 to check for karma use in talents and character action rolls. 
To use karma with a talent, just check the box marked "Karma"
To use a PC action with karma, just put "with karma" after the Step #.
If the PC is out of karma, it will not be added to the roll.
If you have an NPC that is a 'Name Giver' and therefore uses karma, you'll need to use a PC sheet for them.
Added basic conditions to the effects sidebar. (no automation yet)
Added functionality to drop rolls on map token.
Added options for mystic attacks and social attacks. (Use "Mystic Attack" or "Social Attack" in ability description)
