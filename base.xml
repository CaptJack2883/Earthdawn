<!-- TODO List

CRITICALLY IMPORTANT

Potential Hint: "linked fields"

TODO: Fix rSource on NPC rolls.
TODO: In Progress: Get CT Menu working (rest, etc.) Menu is technically working, just need to add the rest of the nodes.
TODO: Make HP boxes (current damage) allow add/drop for Charsheet and NPCs

This is caused by opening a map, then closing that map, then opening any map and adding tokens to it.
TODO: Fix FGC "Script Error: [string "scripts/manager_image.lua"]:208: attempt to call field 'getDatabaseNode' (a nil value)"
TODO: Fix FGC "Script Error: [string "scripts/manager_image.lua"]:223: attempt to call field 'getDatabaseNode' (a nil value)"
TODO: Fix FGU [ERROR]  Handler error: [string "scripts/manager_image.lua"]:208: attempt to index local 'vImage' (a userdata value)
Not related to these warnings, because they occur on CoreRPG without causing the error.
